Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

In the cafe class I overloaded the constructor and the sellCoffee method. The contructor I overloaded because not every cafe is guarenteed to have the same attributes as another when they are created. Additionally, I overloaded the sellCoffee method because not everyone wants sugar and cream in their coffe, so this makes the coffee more customizable.

In the house class I overloaded the constructor and the hasDiningHall method. The constructor I overloaded because not every house has the same attributes as another when they are created. Additionally, I overloaded the hasDiningHall method because some houses may have more than one dining hall.

In the library class I overloaded the constructor and the containsTitle method. The constructor I overloaded because not every library has the same attributes as another when they are created. Additionally, I overloaded the containsTitle method to allow to search the collection for not only a specific title, but also a specific author.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I felt like it was really easy to override methods, but harder to overload them. Additionally, because the instructions to override methods were very direct, it felt easier. However I struggled more with the creative side of the overloading.
